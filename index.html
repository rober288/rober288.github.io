       <h4>Bio: Hi, I’m Rory! I was born and raised in Washington State. I love to paint, listen to jazz on vinyl, and go swimming. I also love drinking tea and making lavender matcha lates on break. I am currently a college student studying graphic design and I hope to go into a field that focuses on both Branding and UX/UI Design.  Copywrite Info</h4>
